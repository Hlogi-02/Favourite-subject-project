              A natural disaster is characterized by the abnormal intensity of a natural agent (flood, mudslide, earthquake, avalanche, drought) when the usual measures to be taken to prevent this damage were not able to prevent their emergence or were not able to be taken.

            <div class="theme">
              Geography is the scientific study of Earth's surface, its physical features, and human populations, focusing on where things are, why they are there, and how they change over time. It is an interdisciplinary field that examines both the natural environment, such as landforms and climate, and the human environment, including culture, politics, and settlements.

              Urban, suburban, and rural describe types of communities: Urban
              areas are dense city centers with high populations and tall
              buildings; suburban areas are residential areas near cities,
              offering a mix of homes and businesses with lower density than
              urban areas; and rural areas are characterized by low population
              density, much open space, and a landscape of farms and natural
              scenery

              Map coordinates define a precise location on Earth using latitude
              and longitude. Latitude measures a point's north or south distance
              from the Equator, while longitude measures its east or west
              distance from the Prime Meridian

          <div class="theme">
            Landforms are the natural physical features on Earth's surface, shaped by processes like tectonic forces, erosion, and volcanic activity, including mountains (elevated land with steep slopes), valleys (low areas between mountains), plateaus (flat-topped highlands), plains (vast flat areas), deserts (arid regions), and rivers and coasts (shaped by water).

          <div class="theme">
            Rivers are diverse, categorized by their water flow as permanent (year-round), periodic (seasonal), episodic (rarely, after heavy rain), and exotic (flowing from a wet area into a dry one). Geographically, rivers are analyzed by their longitudinal profile (source to mouth), cross-profile (a cross-section view), and their distinct upper, middle, and lower courses, each with unique landforms like waterfalls, meanders, and floodplains.
